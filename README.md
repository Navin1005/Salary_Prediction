In this project, I developed a Machine Learning web application using Python and Streamlit. Leveraging real-world data, I analyzed and built a predictive model to solve a specific problem. The application consists of two main parts:

Data Analysis and Model Building: I conducted thorough data analysis, exploring insights and patterns in the dataset. Using machine learning techniques, I built and trained a predictive model tailored to the problem domain.

Web Application Development with Streamlit: I implemented the model into an interactive web interface using Streamlit. The application allows users to input data and receive predictions in real-time, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

This project not only enhanced my skills in data analysis and machine learning but also showcased my ability to translate models into practical applications using Streamlit. It stands as a testament to my proficiency in Python, machine learning, and web development.
